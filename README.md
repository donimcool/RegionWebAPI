# RegionWebAPI

I did not had much time to complete the task and thought that using ADO.Net would be fasterm but i was wrong.
I could have made DB Operations Asynchronous but it took me longer than thought to do that.
As per Finding the Parent Region Recursively in the Get Route, a procedure would be cleaner.
